# Concert-Finder

This program essentially helps a user to find several concerts of a specific artist going on in several countries,using a mix of node.js,express.js,Nunjucks the templating engine and Fetch/API, the user is able to not only find several concerts in a specific country but if they choose,they can also download the files as well incase they need to see the concerts without necessarily coming back to the server.

I did this to improve my form creation,API and Templating skills as well as make sure my program helped to solve a problem that others would go through and provide a really important solution.
